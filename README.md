English pronunciation and vocabulary Anki deck by Eliaz Bobadilla.

The former generated deck snapshot has been removed. New releases will be
created only from pinned inputs and the reproducible build pipeline.

This project is being rebuilt as a reproducible Python pipeline for English
pronunciation and vocabulary Anki decks. The exact frequency list and source
versions are still unresolved; the legacy `60k` label must not be read as a
verified frequency source.

## 📌 Overview

- **Vocabulary**: determined by a pinned frequency source once selected.

- **Dictionary & Audio**:
  [Merriam-Webster's Learner's Dictionary](https://dictionaryapi.com/) (with
  native audio pronunciations)

  - Supplementary: [Wiktionary (via Kaikki.org)](https://kaikki.org/) used to
    fill gaps.

- **Card Structure**: Fully atomic—each card corresponds to exactly one
  definition.

- **Total Cards**: \~66,000

- **Organization**: Words divided into 20 frequency-based sub-decks, from most
  frequent (01k) to least frequent (60k).

- **Exclusions**: Words or definitions not available in Merriam-Webster's
  Learner's Dictionary have been omitted to ensure accuracy and consistency.

## 📁 Planned Deck Structure

```

 └── standard
```

The frequency source and release subdeck policy will be pinned before the
first production build.

## ⚛️ About Atomic Cards

- Cards are ordered by **word frequency**, but each definition is split into its
  own **atomic card**.

  As a result, high-frequency words may surface multiple cards early, including
  less common meanings.

- To make this easier to manage, words with two or more definition cards are
  labeled with sense-priority tags: `core`, `extend`, and `rare`, so you can
  focus on the most useful meanings first.

- If a card is not relevant to your goals, feel free to **suspend** or
  **delete** it.

## 🛠 How to Use

The build CLI is currently being established. The initial validation command
checks the small offline fixture:

```sh
uv run ankglish validate
```

See [SOURCES.md](SOURCES.md) for the current source inventory and unresolved
provider decisions. Release builds will document pinned inputs, cache policy,
quality reports, and import instructions here.

- Download and install [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/).

- Import the deck `.apkg` file.

- Start reviewing from the highest frequency sub-deck for maximum efficiency.

- If you prefer translations in languages other than Simplified Chinese, you can
  edit the `ExampleTR*` fields accordingly.
